            <p>Stepping on the scale isnâ€™t the only way you can gauge whether youâ€™re at a healthy weight.</p>

                Another metric to look at is your body mass index, or BMI. Healthcare providers might use this metric to
                determine your weight category, as itâ€™s a calculation of your body fat in relation to your height and
                weight.</p>

            <h1>Health Risks</h1>
            <h2>Overweight and Obesity</h2>
            <p> Eating a healthy diet, along with getting enough physical activity and sleep, can help children grow up
                healthy and prevent overweight and obesity. In the United States, 20% of young people aged 2 to 19 years
                and 42% of adults have obesity, which can put them at risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some
                cancers.
            </p>
            <h2>Heart Disease and Stroke</h2>
            <p>
                Two of the leading causes of heart disease and stroke are high blood pressure and high blood
                cholesterol. Consuming too much sodium can increase blood pressure and the risk for heart disease and
                stroke. Current guidelines recommend getting less than 2,300 mg a day, but Americans consume more than
                3,400 mg a day on average.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over 70% of the sodium that Americans eat comes from packaged, processed, store-bought, and restaurant
                foods. Eating foods low in saturated fats and high in fiber and increasing access to low-sodium foods,
                along with regular physical activity, can help prevent high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure.
            </p>
            <h2>Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
            <p>
                People who are overweight or have obesity are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those at
                a healthy weight because, over time, their bodies become less able to use the insulin they make. Of US
                adults, 88 millionâ€”more than 1 in 3â€”have prediabetes, and more than 8 in 10 of them donâ€™t know they have
                it.

                Although incidence has decreased in recent years, the number of adults with diagnosed diabetes has
                nearly doubled in the last 2 decades as the US population has increased, aged, and become more
                overweight.
            </p>
            <h2>Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                An unhealthy diet can increase the risk of some cancers. Consuming unhealthy food and beverages, such as
                sugar-sweetened beverages and highly processed food, can lead to weight gain, obesity and other chronic
                conditions that put people at higher risk of at least 13 types of cancer, including endometrial
                (uterine) cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and colorectal cancer. The risk of colorectal
                cancer is also associated with eating red and processed meat.</p>

            <h1>Nutrients</h1>
            <p>Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant,
                child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of
                non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.</p>


            <p>
                Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a
                double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight</p>
            <p>Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as
                well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. However, increased production of
                processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns.
                People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people
                do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual
                characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally
                available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet
                remain the same.</p>
